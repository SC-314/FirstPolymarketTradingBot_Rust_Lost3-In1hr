Live experimentation:
I left the bot with 70$ 30 minutes later I had 67$, I lost pretty much every trade due to the around
6c per trade that were for fees. I was struggling to out weight them. My good trades
just ended up canceling the fees, but not actual profiting.

Due to fees, it seems that holding the tokens until the end of the 15min is better than
selling, because otherwise you pay the 3% twice on buy and sell.
I need the implement proper sound logic for the amount I buy, instead of just buying 5$ worth
of shares, this means I need to have some sort of statistal value for each buy amount, that 
somehow accounts for the -3% transaction fee.

For example, no longer using VolumeWeightedAveragePrice, and using another metric i dont know yet.
